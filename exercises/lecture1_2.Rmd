## The dice problem

Suppose I have a box with a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die.
I choose one of the dice at random, roll it, and report that the outcome is a 1.
What is the probability that I chose the 6-sided die?

Here's a solution using a Bayes table:
```

```{python}
table = pd.DataFrame(index=[4, 6, 8, 12, 20])
table['prior'] = Fraction(1, 5)
table['likelihood'] = Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(1, 6), Fraction(1, 8), Fraction(1, 12), Fraction(1, 20)
table
```

```{python}
table['unnorm'] = table['prior'] * table['likelihood']
prob_data = table['unnorm'].sum()
table['posterior'] = table['unnorm'] / prob_data
table
```

```{python}
import thinkplot
```
